# Birthday-reminder

This is practice project of reactJs . It's the first project of freecodecamp 15 react projects. I have taken 5 profiles from Random profile generator API to display information. I had learnt how to use useState hook and also how to use external API in react project. You can visit https://react-projects-1-birthday-reminder.netlify.app/ this link to see how exactly this project will work.
